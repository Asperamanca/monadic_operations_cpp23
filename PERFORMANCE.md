# General setup
## System
- Windows 11
- AMD Ryzen 5 5500
- 16 GB RAM
## Compilers
- MSVC 19.43 (Release /DWIN32 /D_WINDOWS /W3 /GR /EHsc /MD /O2 /Ob2 /DNDEBUG -std:c++latest)
- llvm-MinGW 18.1.6 (-O3 -DNDEBUG -std=gnu++23 -fansi-escape-codes -fcolor-diagnostics)
- MinGW 13 (-O3 -DNDEBUG -std=gnu++23 -fdiagnostics-color=always)
- MinGW 14 (-O3 -DNDEBUG -std=gnu++23 -fdiagnostics-color=always)

If you think it's unfair to compare MSVC's O2 with O3 from other compilers...that's what I get when I configure "Release build" with C++23
# Benchmark comparing std::ranges::views with classic raw loops
## Test setup
- 50 items in initial range
- 1000 Iterations
## Test description
Input is filled with numbers 1..size (std::iota)
Intermediate values are generated by creating an iota again for each number:
 1 -> 1
 2 -> 1,2
 3 -> 1,2,3
etc.
This is done with 3 levels of nesting, so
 3 -> 1,2,3 -> 1,1,2,1,2,3 -> 1,1,1,2,1,1,2,1,2,3
etc.
This blows up the intermediate range nicely in a fashion that is not deterministic in order
 (because the original input is random_shuffle'd every time)
 but that is deterministic in which values exist.
Then, the intermediate values are folded to a single result, the results collected,
 summed up and averaged, and the final result printed.
The point of the exercise is to prevent the compiler from optimizing away the whole loop
 (which might happen if the results were never used, for example)
Only the segment which calculates the per-iteration result from the initial input is benchmarked.
## Test implementations
1. Classic loop to build intermediate vector, loop to accumulate result
2. Same as (1), but with a pre-allocated vector
3. Classic loop with integrated accumulation of final result
4. Create view on intermediate range, loop to accumulate result
5. Like (1), but use a view to build the initial vector
